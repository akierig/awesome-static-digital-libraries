## Thanks
- I shamelessly adapted this list format from the truly awesome [Awesome Node.js](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs) list.
- I owe [Benjamin Armintor](https://twitter.com/barmintor) a case of beer for putting up with my endless pestering on this topic. Many of these links were found by him. Ben is a good egg.
- I also swiped a bunch of links from Kaitlin Newson and Kim Pham's Code4Lib workshop, if you haven't yet checked out their [slides](https://github.com/kaitlinnewson/c4l18-workshop-staticweb), you should.
